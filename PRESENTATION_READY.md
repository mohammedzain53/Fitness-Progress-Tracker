## 💡 Questions Your Teacher Might Ask

### Q: "How does the data processing work?"
**A:** "The data_processor module handles CSV loading, column normalization, data merging, and metric calculation. It uses Pandas for efficient data manipulation."

### Q: "Why did you choose this architecture?"
**A:** "I used a component-based architecture for separation of concerns, maintainability, and reusability. Each component has a single responsibility."

### Q: "How did you implement the animations?"
**A:** "I used CSS keyframe animations with custom timing functions. The animations are performance-optimized and use GPU acceleration."

### Q: "Can this scale to larger datasets?"
**A:** "Yes, Pandas is optimized for large datasets. The visualizations use Plotly which handles thousands of data points efficiently."

### Q: "How long did this take?"
**A:** "The project demonstrates understanding of web development, data visualization, component architecture, and modern UI/UX principles."
